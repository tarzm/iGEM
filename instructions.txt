How to run (day-to-day)
Activate venv and run with your saved env settings:

source .venv/bin/activate
export PH_ADC_CHANNEL=0 PH_VREF=3.3
export PH_CAL_LOW_PH=7.00 PH_CAL_LOW_V=1.70 PH_CAL_HIGH_PH=4.00 PH_CAL_HIGH_V=2.10
export FAN_PIN=12 FAN_THRESHOLD=24
python3 app.py


Open on the Pi: http://localhost:5050
Open from another device on same network/hotspot: http://:5050
Troubleshooting
pH shows “--”: calibration env vars not set or invalid. Set PH_CAL_* as above or temporarily use PH_OVERRIDE.
GPIO busy: ensure 
fan.py
 or other scripts aren’t running at the same time; reloader is disabled, but a dangling process can hold the pin. Reboot if needed.
SPI read errors: confirm SPI is enabled, wiring is correct, and spidev is installed. ls /dev/spidev0.0 should exist.
Optional improvements I can add
Add a small “Settings” panel in the UI to view and update calibration/override live (persisted to a JSON file).
Show raw voltage under the pH card for debugging.
Implement a three‑point calibration if you want finer accuracy.
If you want me to wire calibration into the UI and store settings on disk so you don’t need env vars, say the word and I’ll add it.

i dont want to do calibration at the moment. I want to be able to do this later.

You don’t need to calibrate now. Use a fixed pH for display and add calibration later when you’re ready.

Recommended setup now (no calibration)
Set a temporary pH value with an environment variable and run the app:
Show pH 7.2, for example:

bash
source .venv/bin/activate
export PH_OVERRIDE=7.2
# optional fan settings if needed
export FAN_PIN=12
export FAN_THRESHOLD=24
python3 app.py

The UI will show your chosen pH while temperature is live from DS18B20.
You can change PH_OVERRIDE anytime (e.g., 7.0, 7.4) without touching the code.
Later, when you want real pH
You already wired MCP3008 on SPI and the code reads it. To convert voltage → pH:
Measure voltage in two buffers (e.g., pH 7.00 and 4.00).
Set these env vars before starting:

PH_CAL_LOW_PH, PH_CAL_LOW_V
PH_CAL_HIGH_PH, PH_CAL_HIGH_V

Example:

bash
export PH_CAL_LOW_PH=7.00
export PH_CAL_LOW_V=1.70
export PH_CAL_HIGH_PH=4.00
export PH_CAL_HIGH_V=2.00
export PH_ADC_CHANNEL=0
export PH_VREF=3.3

python3 app.py
Remove PH_OVERRIDE to use the calibrated pH.
Optional (tell me if you want this)
I can make the UI show the raw ADC voltage under the pH card while pH is overridden or uncalibrated.
This helps you see the live signal now and calibrate later from the same screen.
